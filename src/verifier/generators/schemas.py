# Verifier bundle generation-half module (self-contained; no external deps on the vendored source).
"""Result schemas for a verification run.

A ``VerificationReport`` is the artifact written to
``outputs/<uuid>/verification/results/<model>/agent/run_<N>/report.json``.
It carries both a **gate** (keep/quarantine) and a **graded score** (per the
locked decision that we emit both).
