# Verifier bundle generation-half module (self-contained; no external deps on the vendored source).
"""P4 — TRUTH.md authoring.

TRUTH.md is the path-agnostic answer key: what a correct solve must ACHIEVE and
how a skilled engineer would get there — derived FROM the golden patch (base ->
reference diff) but abstracted so it prescribes a destination, not a route. The
golden diff is a *private authoring aid*; TRUTH.md must not reproduce it verbatim
(the leak-guard) and must enumerate valid alternative approaches (path-agnosticism).

Authoring is host-side only and never mounted into the agent container.
