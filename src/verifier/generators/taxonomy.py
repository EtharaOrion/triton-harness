# Verifier bundle generation-half module (self-contained; no external deps on the vendored source).
"""The frozen Concern Taxonomy — the single source of truth for *what* a complete
trajectory verification must cover, and *who* (which layer) owns each concern.

This replaces the "..." placeholder the adversarial review flagged: the set of
concerns is enumerated in full and versioned. Two invariants make the framework's
"complete + non-duplicative" claim machine-checkable (see the registry lint in
``tests/test_verification_core.py``):

  * COMPLETENESS  — every concern in the taxonomy is assigned exactly one owner.
  * NON-DUPLICATION — no concern is owned by two layers; a deterministic check and
    a rubric criterion never target the same concern id.

Each concern carries the *phase* that implements its check. A concern whose phase
has not yet shipped is still registered here (so coverage is provably complete)
and is emitted as ``PENDING`` at evaluation time — honest about what is and isn't
yet enforced, rather than silently uncovered.

Concern id grammar: ``L{layer}.{SHORT_NAME}``.

# test suite / commit0 evaluate* owns that). So a check contributes in exactly one
# of three ways:
#   * "legitimacy" — a gating check: a FAIL quarantines the trajectory.
#   * "process"    — trajectory-quality: feeds the graded score.
#   * "honesty"    — the check compares the SOLUTION to the golden purely to expose

#                    non-gating and is NOT folded into the score; it drives a
#                    separate boolean honesty signal. Marking a solution down for
