# Verifier bundle generation-half module (self-contained; no external deps on the vendored source).
"""The Concern Registry as a machine-checkable artifact (plan §4.4).

Emits ``coverage.json`` — the single source of truth for WHAT is covered and by
WHOM (which layer/owner), plus whether each concern is currently ENFORCED (has a
check) or PENDING. `registry_violations()` is the completeness + non-duplication
lint: every concern has exactly one owner, owners match layers, and no id repeats.
