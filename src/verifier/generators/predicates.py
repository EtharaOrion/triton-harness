# Verifier bundle generation-half module (self-contained; no external deps on the vendored source).
"""#1 — the generated task-specific DETERMINISTIC layer (plan §3.3).

The rubric generates *judgment* criteria; this generates *decidable* criteria — a
whitelist of predicate types the model instantiates from TRUTH.md and that our code
evaluates deterministically against the agent's produced code (the cumulative
patch). This is the missing "generate pytest from TRUTH.md" half.

Only truly-decidable predicate types are allowed (no free-form semantic assertions —
those belong in the rubric). Each generated predicate SHOULD ship a negative fixture
(a snippet that must FAIL it); a predicate whose negative fixture still passes is
vacuous and rejected (`prune_vacuous`), turning "cites TRUTH.md" into "provably
exercises TRUTH.md".
